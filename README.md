# io-lib
A library that aims to simplify serial communication and Modbus communication 

This is still in the early development stage. Please report any bugs.
## Modbus Use
Currently, the Modbus part of the library can only act as a master that communications with slaves. In the future,
this might be able to act as a slave

Be aware that not all the functions of this library have been tested and I am not responsible for any damage done
from bugs in this library. If you need to use this for an industrial application, you should go with a library
that has been tested. This library aims to provide an open source heavily object oriented approach to modbus mappings.

## TODO
* Implement Modbus exception codes and throw Java Exceptions corresponding to them
